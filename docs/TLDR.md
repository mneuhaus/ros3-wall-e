# TLDR

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive system for the Wallâ€‘E robot built on a Raspberry Pi CM4 running ROS2. It integrates custom firmware and hardware components to deliver robust, interactive control and feedback.

## Main Components
- **ROS2 & CM4:** Central controller orchestrating robot behavior via ROS2 nodes.
- **Servo 2040:** Microcontroller managing up to 18 servo channels for precise motion.
- **Motor Controller:** Differential drive system using a Cytron MD13S board.
- **Eyes & Display:** Custom firmware for visual interaction.
- **Web Interface & Audio:** Tools for remote monitoring, control, and sound feedback.

## Goals & Principles
- **Modularity:** Clear separation between hardware, firmware, and software.
- **Robust Communication:** Utilization of the EVE protocol for reliable interactions.
- **User-Friendliness:** Intuitive interfaces and comprehensive, up-to-date documentation.
- **Maintainability:** Adhering to coding conventions and structured project architecture.

A succinct overview capturing the essence of a robust, interactive, and modular system.
